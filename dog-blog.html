      <h2>I am a dog! How am I blogging?</h2>

      <p>I'm kind of a klutz so it's a miracle that I'm able to type. Here
        are my favorite toys:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A gross piece of rope.</li>
          <li>A squeaky hamburger.</li>
          <li>Sticks that are too big for me to carry.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Here are my favorite places to sleep:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>My bed upstairs</li>
            <ul>
              <li>(As long as it's warm upstairs)</li>
              <li>(And usually at night)</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The chair in the living room</li>
          <li>On the grass in the backyard</li>
          <li>Basically anywhere</li>
        </ol>
